        <h2>Love nature, outdoors and great times with my dogs! </h2>
        <p>
          Born 1991 in Sundsvall, Sweden. Love to see myself and others develop
          and i'm not afraid of a little challenge. I actually think I like them
          more than many. In a challenge I allways learn something new! In
          recent years, I have had many challenges in the form of accidents.
          Broke my shoulder blade in a Downhill (bike) accident in 2020 and in
          2022 I was involved in a work accident where I got spinal stenosis and
          couldn't walk. But I'm back and I'm really sharp in rehab. I love to
          exercise so the exercise itself has not been the biggest challenge.
          It's been the mental part. But I also took the opportunity there to
          actually learn something, so I took a course in Mental training and I
          have come out as a stronger person in every way!! In the shape of my
          life and stronger than ever mentally!
        </p>
        <h2>
          And that journy has brought me here, To be a student again and learn
          all about code, developing, fontend, backend, AI
        </h2>
        <p>
          I was an entrepreneur before the accident but unfortunately I could
          neither keep the job I was employed at nor the company as it involved
          physically heavy work. I have always liked being an entrepreneur and I
          ran a small upholstery business. Love meeting the customer, solving
          their problems and creating something that is more beautiful than they
          could even imagine in the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the accident I started thinking about my future, I love to
          create, solve problems, learn new things and I love to get to know
          customers and help them get the best. Why not learn something
          completely new at the age of 33?
        </p>
